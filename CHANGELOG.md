# v0.5.9 (2026-06-19) — Windows EADDRINUSE crash-loop fix

Single-purpose patch release. Symptom reported on Windows after upgrading
to 0.5.8:

```
⨯ Failed to start server
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:20128
⚠️  Server exited (code=1). Restarting in 1s... (1/2)
[repeated forever]
```

Two real bugs surfaced by the upgrade:

1. **`killProcessOnPort` only killed the first PID from `netstat`.** Windows
   Next.js spawns a parent + child pair (the dev runner + the actual
   `next-server`); on graceful shutdown only the parent dies and the child
   inherits the listen socket. Killing just the first PID left the child
   still bound to the port. Now sweeps ALL PIDs returned by `netstat`
   (Windows) / `lsof -ti` (macOS/Linux), uses `taskkill /F /T` to kill the
   whole process tree on Windows, and waits 1s on Windows (vs 500ms
   elsewhere) for the kernel to release the socket.

2. **The restart loop didn't re-kill on EADDRINUSE.** When the first start
   failed because a stale process held the port, `tryRestart` just respawned
   blindly into the same conflict — forever. New EADDRINUSE-aware recovery
   path detects "address already in use" in the captured crash log, runs
   `killAllAppProcesses` + `killProcessOnPort` AGAIN, then probes the port
   with a one-shot `net.createServer` before respawning. If the port is
   still occupied after the cleanup, exits with an actionable error:

   ```
   ❌ Port 20128 is still occupied after attempted cleanup.
      Identify the holder (Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :20128;
      macOS/Linux: lsof -i:20128).
      Either stop that process, or run kRouter on a different port:
      krouter --port <N>
   ```

   No more infinite "Disabling MIT and restarting..." (which was the wrong
   recovery anyway — EADDRINUSE has nothing to do with MITM, which runs on
   port 26139).

Verified
  - node --check passes
  - Isolated unit test: spawn victim child holding port → run kill logic →
    probe → port free → PROBE OK
  - Excludes own PID (won't suicide)

# v0.5.8 (2026-06-19) — security, brand polish, performance, upstream catch-up

25 commits since 0.5.7 — full audit pass with live end-to-end verification on the dev machine, zero test regressions throughout.

## Security
- **GHSA-6mwv-4mrm-5p3m — Kiro AWS region SSRF (HIGH).** Port of upstream `126aa24`. Seven `${region}` URL-interpolation sites in `src/lib/oauth/providers.js` and `src/lib/oauth/services/kiro.js` were unvalidated — a malicious value like `region="us-east-1.attacker.com#"` would have redirected the OAuth flow to an attacker host. New `assertValidAwsRegion()` helper with `/^[a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-\d{1,2}$/` allowlist now gates every interpolation. 12/12 attack vectors blocked in unit tests.
- **2 HIGH npm CVEs eliminated.** `undici` 7.0.0–7.27.2 (TLS cert validation bypass in SOCKS5 ProxyAgent + cache disclosure) → 7.28.0; `http-proxy-middleware` 3.0.4–3.0.6 (CRLF injection in `fixRequestBody`) → 3.0.7. Both already in MITM/proxy paths. Only 2 moderate `postcss` advisories remain (transitive via Next 16, fix would be a breaking Next downgrade — left).

## Performance — Anthropic + Antigravity rate-limit storms
- **Claude Usage per-token 3-min cooldown + stale-while-revalidate cache** (`open-sse/services/usage.js`). The Quota Tracker page auto-refreshes every 60s × N connections. Anthropic rate-limits per IP — once any Claude account 429'd, every subsequent call from the same IP also 429'd, blanking the entire Claude card. Now on any 429, that token sits in 3-min cooldown returning cached-good data (slightly stale, real numbers) instead of placeholder. **17× quieter** against Anthropic during cooldown windows. Also skip the legacy admin-only fallback when status is 429 (saves 2 wasted calls per rate-limit event). Cooldown latency dropped 400ms → 6ms (pure-memory, no I/O).
- **Antigravity retry-storm fix** (`open-sse/executors/antigravity.js`). 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED with a 73-min reset was triggering 14-28s of pointless 2-4-8s auto-retries per URL × multiple combo models → up to 4 min per request on big projects. Root causes: regex looked for `"reset after"` but Google sends `"Resets in"`; and we never parsed the canonical `error.details[].retryDelay` field (e.g. `"4406.752244244s"`). New `parseRetryFromErrorJson()` reads the machine-readable RetryInfo first; widened message-text regex covers current Google phrasing, beta Antigravity variant, token-bucket style, and bare durations. Combo now advances to the next model in the same instant.
- **`claudeAutoPing` skips disabled accounts.** When the OAuth-usage endpoint reports `extra_usage.disabled_reason` (e.g. `"out_of_credits"`, `"account_suspended"`), the scheduler stops trying for 1 hour and logs the reason once per state-change. Recovery (credits topped up, suspension lifted) is auto-detected within the next hour and logged. Saves wasted POSTs to `/v1/messages` that Anthropic would reject anyway.

## Bug fixes
- **Kiro MITM dropped images** (`src/mitm/handlers/kiro.js`). When users attached an image in Kiro IDE chat, the AWS-CodeWhisperer→OpenAI converter read `userInputMessage.content` and `userInputMessageContext.toolResults` but ignored `userInputMessage.images[]`. Every image silently disappeared before reaching the downstream model — which would then hallucinate about random files in the filesystem context to fill the gap. Now converts each `{ format, source.bytes }` entry to standard OpenAI `{ type:"image_url", image_url:{ url:"data:image/<mime>;base64,..." } }` content blocks. 8/8 unit test cases (text-only / image-only / text+N / tool+image combo / format normalization jpg→jpeg / malformed-skip / fallback to png).
- **Claude usage misleading "admin permissions" message.** The legacy fallback used to say "requires admin permissions" regardless of why the OAuth endpoint failed. Now branches on the OAuth status: 429 → "rate-limited", 401 → "rejected the access token — try reconnecting", 5xx → "upstream error", other → existing scoped message.
- **Perplexity `/v1/models` endpoint fix** (port of upstream `db4499d`). Perplexity deprecated `/models` (404); switched both test-connection and live-models routes to `/v1/models`.
- **claudeAutoPing dual-write consolidation.** The Providers detail page wrote `settings.claudeAutoPing.connections` from stale local state; the Usage page used safer fetch-then-patch. Toggling auto-ping on Page A then Page B could clobber A's update. Providers page now mirrors Usage's race-safe pattern.

## Features ported from upstream
- **Claude auto-ping** (`740093d`) — warms each Claude OAuth connection's 5h quota window by sending a 1-token "hi" the moment the window resets. Per-connection toggle (bolt icon) on Settings → Providers → Claude AND Dashboard → Usage. New `src/shared/services/claudeAutoPing.js` scheduler + `CLAUDE_AUTOPING_CONFIG` in `src/shared/constants/config.js` + UI integration on both surfaces.
- **Fusion combo strategy** (`87e5c1c`) — third combo strategy alongside fallback/round-robin. Fans the prompt out to all panel models in parallel, then a judge model synthesizes one final answer. Quorum-grace collection caps the straggler penalty (8s after `minPanel=2` succeed); 90s panel hard timeout; anonymized "Source N" labels prevent judge brand-bias; degrades gracefully (0 answers → 503, 1 answer → direct return, 2+ → judge synthesizes). Per-combo strategy `Select` replaces the round-robin toggle; fusion reveals a judge-model picker on the Combos page.
- **Custom vision models in selector** (`5e5e78d`) — user-added `imageToText` custom models now appear in the LLM picker with `capabilities: { vision: true }` instead of being filtered out.
- **Kiro thinking-effort budgets** (`2ff1124`) — Kiro requests with `reasoning_effort: "low"` get 1024 thinking tokens, "high" gets 24576 (was always 16000 default — caused visible CoT to leak into chat on low-effort tasks).
- **Antigravity Gemini schema** (`db9ec3a`) — strip `optional` field from tool schemas before sending to Gemini (Google rejects it).
- **claude-to-openai non-streaming** (`411a589`) — handle OpenAI-format responses from xiaomi-tokenplan -claude models on the non-streaming path; strip `reasoning_content` only when content is non-empty.
- **Image routing prefix collision** (`047fdc8`) — compatible nodes can no longer shadow built-in provider aliases like `cf/...`.
- **Antigravity output_config strip + Xiaomi always-OpenAI** (`3f9382d` partial) — strip Claude adaptive fields Google rejects; always use OpenAI `/chat/completions` for Xiaomi.

## New dashboard surface
- **Settings → Environment panel** (`/dashboard/environment`). 47 catalogued env vars in 8 categories (App, Security, Network/Proxy, MITM/Tunnel, OAuth, Observability, Updater, plus "Other" for uncatalogued `KROUTER_*`/`NINE_ROUTER_*`/`MITM_*`/etc. set in env). Live values shown, secrets masked (`INITIAL_PASSWORD` displays as `to••••••••23`), deprecated `NINE_ROUTER_*` flagged with amber badge, eye-icon to reveal, search + "only show set" filter. New `/api/settings/environment` endpoint, sidebar entry under System → Environment.

## Upgrade safety
- **`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env-var migration + dangling autostart sweep** (`src/mitm/paths.js`, `cli/src/cli/tray/autostart.js`). For v0.5.6 → v0.5.7 upgraders who had MITM enabled, the system-wide env var still pointed at `~/.9router/mitm/rootCA.crt`. Every Node child process (including npm) saw the stale path. Now `migrateNodeExtraCaCerts()` updates the OS env var to the new cert path via `launchctl setenv` / `setx` immediately after the dir rename. Plus `sweepDanglingAutostartEntries()` on startup detects + removes LaunchAgent / .desktop / .vbs entries whose binary path no longer exists on disk (e.g. when the legacy `9router` global package was uninstalled).
- **Legacy `~/.9router/` coexistence warning** (`src/lib/dataDir.js`, `cli/cli.js`). Auto-migration only fires when the target is absent. Users who ran a pre-rename build mid-session then upgraded kept two parallel data dirs silently forever. Now warns once per process when both exist, gives exact merge/remove commands. Does NOT auto-delete (user data).
- **`KROUTER_*` env-var aliases with deprecation log** (`src/lib/network/outboundProxy.js`). Proxy env vars were still `NINE_ROUTER_PROXY_URL`/etc. only — users setting `KROUTER_PROXY_URL` were silently ignored. Now dual-reads (canonical preferred), dual-writes (existing IDE/shell hooks keep working), one-shot deprecation warning per process when only the legacy name is set.

## Brand polish
- **Hero CTA link** (`src/app/landing/components/HeroSection.js`) — "View on GitHub" above-the-fold pointed at `decolua/9router`; now `sifxprime/krouter`.
- **README install + quickstart blocks** — `~/.9router` → `~/.krouter`, `sk-9router-XXXX` → `sk-krouter-XXXX`, "Point AI tool at 9router" → "at kRouter"; OpenClaw config example updated to current `krouter` provider key + `sk_krouter` placeholder; env-var table defaults corrected. Upstream-Docker callout section kept unchanged (still correctly documents upstream's published image).
- **Tray icons regenerated as Kodelyth Mark.** `cli/src/cli/tray/icon.png` was stale 32×32 PNG from Jun 13, predating the brand mark — on Windows the tray showed a generic icon. Re-rendered from the exact Sidebar.js inline SVG (rounded-square tile with brand-500 → brand-700 gradient + white chevron forward + 25% ghost trail). `icon.ico` is now **multi-size 16+32+48** instead of single 32×32, so Windows tray renders crisp at every DPI scale. `public/favicon.svg` is now a standalone brand-500 chevron — browser tab matches the rebrand.
- **Update endpoint error string** (`src/app/api/version/update/route.js:7`) — `"9router CLI"` → `"kRouter CLI"`.
- 2 stale `9Router` refs in `cli/src/cli/tray/tray.ps1` + `cli/src/cli/tray/copilot.js` MITM handler + `src/app/globals.css` CSS comment + 2 stale `~/.9router/runtime` doc/log strings.

## LAN-safety polish
- **LAN-exposure warning** (`cli/cli.js`). On default `0.0.0.0` bind, prints a yellow startup line: `⚠ Network-exposed: reachable at http://<lan-ip>:<port> (bound 0.0.0.0). Use --host 127.0.0.1 for local-only.` Previously you had no signal the dashboard was reachable from your LAN. Port of upstream's `getLanIp` helper.

# v0.5.7 (2026-06-18) — kRouter rebrand: visible surfaces + safe migrations

Final rebrand pass turning every user-visible "9router/9Router" identifier into the canonical `krouter/kRouter` name, with one-time migrations on disk so existing v0.5.x installs upgrade cleanly with zero data loss and zero double-launch.

## Data directory rename with auto-migration
- `~/.9router/` → `~/.krouter/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\9router\` → `%APPDATA%\krouter\`). Idempotent `fs.renameSync` runs on first launch only when the new dir doesn't exist and the legacy one does — wired into five separate entry points (`src/mitm/paths.js`, `src/lib/dataDir.js`, `cli/cli.js`, `cli/hooks/sqliteRuntime.js`, `cli/src/cli/api/client.js`) so any process startup path migrates.
- Linux MITM trust-store file renamed `9router-root-ca.crt` → `krouter-root-ca.crt`. Uninstall removes both.
- macOS keychain CN unchanged ("9Router MITM Root CA") — keychain trusts by CN not file path, so the cert moves with the data dir and HTTPS keeps working with zero re-trust prompts.

## CLI tools rename with dual-read backward compat
Every IDE config writer (OpenCode, OpenClaw, JCode, Codex, Kilo, Cline, Copilot, Hermes, DeepSeek-TUI, Droid, Cowork-MCP) now writes the canonical `krouter` provider key, and detects the legacy `9router` key as a read-fallback. On the next "Apply" click the user's IDE config converges to canonical names. Specifics:
- OpenCode `provider["krouter"]`, model prefix `krouter/`, dual-match regex `^(?:krouter|9router)\/`
- OpenClaw `providers["krouter"]` in `models.providers`, `agents.list`, and per-agent `models.json`
- JCode `providers["krouter"]`, env file renamed `provider-krouter.env`, env var `JCODE_KROUTER_API_KEY`; legacy env file removed on write; CLI flag now `jcode --provider-profile krouter`
- Codex `model_provider = "krouter"`, `[model_providers.krouter]` section; legacy section removed on next save
- Droid `custom:kRouter-N` IDs; legacy `custom:9Router-N` detected as fallback
- 25+ `sk_9router` localhost placeholder API keys → `sk_krouter` (not validated server-side, safe to rename)
- localStorage key for endpoint presets migrated; legacy key read once then removed

## CLI / system-tray visible surfaces
- Tray menu label + tooltip: `9Router (Port N)` → `kRouter (Port N)`
- Console messages: `🔔 9Router is running in tray` → `🔔 kRouter ...`
- Terminal UI title + breadcrumb: `📡 kRouter Terminal UI`
- macOS plist log paths: `/tmp/krouter.log` + `/tmp/krouter.error.log`
- npm postinstall log prefix: `[krouter] runtime SQLite deps ready`
- Tray + SQLite runtime npm-package name: `krouter-runtime`
- Linux .desktop `Name=kRouter`, `Comment=kRouter API Proxy`

## Autostart bundle ID migration with self-kill protection
The macOS LaunchAgent identifier moved from `com.9router.autostart` → `com.krouter.autostart`. A `cleanupLegacyMacOSAutostart()` helper runs on every enable/disable: unloads the legacy plist with launchd, deletes the file from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, then writes the new one. Self-kill protection: if the current Node process IS the running legacy launchd-managed agent, the unload step is skipped (would SIGTERM us mid-execution) — file removal alone is sufficient, launchd releases the agent on next login. Linux `.desktop` and Windows `.vbs` filenames migrate the same way (legacy file removed before new file written). `isAutoStartEnabled()` returns true for either entry so a pre-rename install still reads as enabled until next toggle.

## Dashboard sidebar wordmark
Now rendered in CAPITAL via Tailwind `uppercase` + 0.04em tracking — `KROUTER` with `v0.5.7` below. Kodelyth Mark on the brand-orange tile unchanged.

## Intentionally NOT changed
- HTTP wire-protocol identifiers (`X-CLIENT-TYPE`, `X-Msh-Platform`, `grok-cli/9router` user-agent, `x-9r-cli-token`, `9r-cli-auth`) — sent to/shared with third-party services or between client+server; renaming requires coordinated changes with no user benefit.
- `decolua/9router` upstream-credit links in landing nav/footer — intentional attribution to fork source.

## Verification on maintainer's machine
- `~/.9router/` (1.4 MB `data.sqlite`, auth, jwt-secret, machine-id, MITM cert) → `~/.krouter/` migrated in-place, all files intact, zero data loss.
- `com.9router.autostart.plist` cleanly removed; `com.krouter.autostart.plist` registered with launchd, PID 94237 running, exactly one router process (no double-launch).
- `/api/version` HTTP 200 from dev server; every cli-tools settings endpoint compiles and reaches auth gate (HTTP 401), no 500s.
- All 41 modified files pass `node --check`; zero errors or warnings in dev log.

# v0.4.80+sifxprime.1 (2026-06-15) — fork hardening pass

Hardening overlay on top of upstream `decolua/9router@v0.4.80`. Eleven audit findings closed across nine atomic commits; each fix carries a unit test that reproduces the BEFORE behavior plus live end-to-end verification through Kiro → MITM → router → real provider. Bug 11 from the audit was dropped after empirical disproof.

## Security
- **API SSRF guard on user-supplied `baseUrl`** — `GET /api/providers/[id]/models` now validates the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible base URLs. Blocks cloud metadata endpoints (AWS `169.254.169.254`, ECS `169.254.170.2`, Alibaba `100.100.100.200`, GCP `metadata.google.internal`), wildcard binds, and non-`http(s)` schemes. Loopback and private LAN ranges still allowed for self-hosted LLMs. (Bug 3, c8e3636)
- **Timing-safe CLI token compare** — replaced naive `===` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` via a `safeEqString` helper. 200k-sample test: byte-position timing ratio drops from 2.22× (OLD oracle) to 0.96× (within noise band). (Bug 9, d680881)
- **Per-IP brute-force lockout on auth failures** — new `src/lib/auth/apiAuthLimiter.js`. 10-fail threshold, progressive lockout 30 s → 2 m → 10 m → 30 m, 1 h auto-reset, per-IP isolation. Held in a separate bucket from login attempts. Loopback origins explicitly skip the limiter to avoid collateral damage on the `"unknown"` IP fallback bucket. (Bug 10, d680881)
- **EventStream encoder bounds checks** — `kiro.js` `encodeHeader` now throws on header-name > 255 B and value > 65 535 B; `buildEventStreamFrame` caps total frame at 16 MiB. Prevents silent uint8/uint16 wrap-around producing corrupt frames that surface in Kiro as `"Truncated event message received"`. (Bug 12, 660eaa0)

## Concurrency & Auth
- **No mutation of caller credentials on token refresh** — `chatCore.handleChatCore` replaced `Object.assign(credentials, newCredentials)` with `{ ...credentials, ...newCredentials }` and threaded the new object into the retry. Eliminates a race where two concurrent requests sharing the same credentials reference could see each other's tokens swapped mid-stream. (Bug 1, 6020127)
- **Retry response always adopted after refresh** — the 401-retry block no longer keeps the stale 401 when the retry returns non-ok or throws. Downstream `parseUpstreamError` now reports the actual failure cause instead of `"Unauthorized"`. (Bug 2, f009fca)
- **Atomic `backoffLevel` read-modify-write** — new `updateProviderConnectionAtomic(id, computeUpdates)` in `connectionsRepo.js`; `markAccountUnavailable` rewritten to compute inside the transaction. Concurrent failures no longer lose increments and stall exponential backoff at +1. (Bug 8, a16f685)

## MITM stream layer
- **Upstream HTTP errors surfaced to Kiro as `exception` frames** — `pipeTransformedEventStream` previously hard-coded HTTP 200 with content-type `application/vnd.amazon.eventstream` and dropped the upstream body for any non-OK response. Now reads the error body and emits a parseable AWS EventStream frame with `:message-type=exception` carrying the upstream message. (Bug 6, a05186a)
- **Pipe loops resilient to mid-stream read errors** — `pipeSSE`, `pipeTransformedSSE`, `pipeTransformedEventStream` now wrap the read loop in `try/catch/finally`. On `ECONNRESET` / `socket hang up` / abort: log, run transform-flush, emit a terminal frame (EventStream exception or SSE `[DONE]`), guarantee `res.end()`. Previously the client connection hung until the OS-level socket timeout. Verified: fake router that destroys mid-stream now closes the curl client in ~300 ms with a parseable terminal frame instead of hanging. (Bug 7, 14da886)
- **MITM `requestTimeout = 0`** — disabled Node's default 5-minute `requestTimeout` and `headersTimeout` on the MITM HTTPS server so long-running agentic streams (Kiro extended-thinking, multi-tool analysis) aren't cut mid-frame. (baseline, 6457f87)

## Routing & efficiency
- **Combo recursion depth guard** — added `MAX_COMBO_RECURSION_DEPTH = 3`. A misconfigured combo that cycles (`comboA → comboB → comboA`) or chains too deep now returns HTTP 400 `"Combo recursion limit exceeded"` instead of overflowing the call stack. (Bug 5, 21e8390)
- **Single `getSettings()` per request** — `chat.js` previously read settings 2–3× per request (top-level + inside the `while(true)` account-fallback loop + a third time in the nested-combo branch). Now read once at the top of `handleChat` and threaded through. (Bug 4, 21e8390)

## Verification methodology
Every fix shipped with:
- A standalone Node test file that **reproduces the BEFORE behavior** under controlled conditions (race simulations, mock streams that throw mid-read, statistical timing of `===` vs `timingSafeEqual`, etc.) and confirms the **AFTER** behavior fixes it.
- A live end-to-end run through the full stack (real Kiro client → MITM → 9router dev server → real provider), verifying the happy path still returns the expected 200 / 551 B / 4-frame EventStream and that the bug-trigger conditions produce the documented graceful behavior.
- For SSRF (Bug 3): live tests with temp DB rows confirming `169.254.169.254` blocks at HTTP 400 + reason, `api.openai.com` reaches upstream, `192.168.x` LAN IPs pass through to the fetch.
- For Bug 11 (audit drop): empirical test of `pipeWithDisconnect` showed `upstream.cancel()` fires within 1 ms of client disconnect via `reader.cancel()` propagation through `pipeThrough`. The "fake writer" stub is necessary (the writable side is locked by `pipeThrough`) and harmless. No fix needed.
