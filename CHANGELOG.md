# v0.5.33 (2026-06-23) — cacheControlMode toggle + quota freshness tracking

User-visible: dashboard now exposes a Cache Control toggle (auto/always/never) that controls whether kRouter mutates `cache_control` markers on Claude-shape requests. Quota usage endpoint now reports cache freshness so the dashboard can show "last checked Xs ago" without a second round-trip, and a manual refresh endpoint forces a fresh upstream fetch on demand.

## Cache Control mode toggle (Tier 3.A)
- New setting `cacheControlMode` with three values:
  - **`auto`** (default, preserves 0.5.32 behavior): skip `cache_control` mutations only on Claude direct passthrough (`clientTool==="claude" && provider==="claude"`).
  - **`always`**: paranoid mode — skip mutations on any Claude-shape target including `anthropic-compatible-*` resellers and the explicit translator path (threaded via `prepareClaudeRequest(preserveCacheControl=true)`).
  - **`never`**: legacy escape hatch (pre-0.5.32 strip-and-rewrite behavior).
- New Cache Control card on `/dashboard/profile` with a `<select>` and live mode-aware explainer text.
- Live-verified: dev log fires `[CACHE] mode=auto | token savers SKIPPED...` and `[CACHE] mode=always | token savers SKIPPED...` on real Claude traffic; `never` correctly suppresses the skip.

## Quota tracker hardening (Tier 3.C)
- `quotaPreflight` gains four new APIs:
  - `getQuotaCacheInfo(provider, connId)` → freshness info (`hasData`, `isFresh`, `isStale`, `lastCheckedAt`, `lastCheckedAgoSec`, `modelCount`)
  - `forceRefreshQuota(provider, connId, connection)` → drop cache + inFlight, refetch upstream
  - `recordQuotaCacheHit(provider, connId)` → tracks last-used for background daemon
  - `startBackgroundQuotaRefresh(connectionsProvider)` → 60s daemon that only refreshes accounts whose hot-path read was within the last 30 min
- `GET /api/usage/[connectionId]` now returns `_cacheInfo` with the freshness fields (backward-compatible — added field, nothing removed).
- `POST /api/usage/[connectionId]` is new — manual refresh endpoint that token-refreshes if OAuth, force-refreshes quota cache, returns `{ ...usage, _cacheInfo, _refreshed: true }`.
- `sse/services/auth.js` records a cache hit after every successful account pick, so the daemon's "recently used" detection mirrors real production usage.
- Daemon ticks confirmed live in isolated node process; in-app firing is timer-driven and survives HMR.

## Test counts
- Pre-release baseline: 983 passing / 20 expected-fail / 21 skipped
- Post-release: **999 passing** / 20 expected-fail / 21 skipped (1040 total)
- +16 new tests across 2 new test files: `cache-control-mode.test.js`, `quota-tracker-hardening.test.js`
- Zero regressions

## Intentionally NOT in this release
- TaskAwareRouter wiring (Tier 3.B) — deferred at user request, same rationale as the skipped Tier 2.B combo intelligence wiring in 0.5.32. Existing routing is working and the user opted to leave it untouched.

# v0.5.32 (2026-06-23) — Claude Desktop token-burn fix + reliability hardening

User-visible: long Claude Desktop / Claude Code sessions routed through kRouter MITM no longer pay 3-10x token cost vs running Claude direct. Anthropic's per-API-key prompt cache now stays warm across continuation turns.

## Cache preservation in Claude direct passthrough (Tier 1)
- **Skip token-saver mutations for Claude direct passthrough.** When `clientTool === "claude" && provider === "claude"` and the request is in passthrough mode, kRouter no longer runs RTK / Caveman / Ponytail on the outbound body. Any byte change to system / tools / messages prefix busts Anthropic's prompt cache key; for a 50-turn Claude Desktop session that was 50 cache misses × 10× tokens on the cached prefix. Now the outbound body is byte-identical to what Claude Desktop sent and Anthropic's cache hits on every continuation turn.
- **Session-sticky account binding.** `getSessionConnection()` infrastructure existed in `sessionManager.js` but was never called. Wired it: every chat request derives a `conversationFingerprint` (model + system + tools + first user message + provider, **without** connectionId) and resolves it to a sticky account via `getStickyConnection()`. Auth picker honours the binding via `preferredConnectionId`. On a successful turn we re-bind the fingerprint to the working account. Failed binding falls through to normal strategy (option a — drop stickiness rather than wait for recovery). For users with `stickyRoundRobinLimit:1`, this stops every-other-turn cache misses from per-key cache rotation.
- **`preserveCacheControl` flag on `prepareClaudeRequest`** (port of OmniRoute's same-named flag). 4th param, default false. When true, skips all cache_control strip-and-rewrite passes on system blocks, message content, and last-assistant injection. Future translation paths (e.g. `anthropic-compatible-cc-*` resellers) can flip this on without touching chatCore.

Live-verified end-to-end on real Anthropic traffic — 3 successful Claude direct turns through the same conversation fingerprint, all routed to the same account, `[AUTH] claude | pinned to <conn>` log line confirms sticky resolution on turn 3+.

## Reactive 400-retry hardening (Tier 2.A + 2.C)
- **`findOffendingField` word-boundary regex** (already shipped in 0.5.31 commit d20703c, included here). Catches bare-name 400 bodies that the previous quoted-only matcher missed: Groq (`Unknown parameter: logprobs`), OpenRouter (`unrecognized field reasoning_content`), Anthropic (`Field \"presence_penalty\" invalid`). Without this, the reactive self-heal silently never fired on the most common upstream error shapes.
- **Verified the full retry chain end-to-end.** Six integration tests run the real `DefaultExecutor.execute()` flow with `proxyAwareFetch` mocked at the network boundary: 400 → `findOffendingField` matches → `delete sourceBody[offendingField]` → real `transformRequest` → real retry fetch → 200 returned. Tests confirm other body fields (temperature, messages, max_tokens) survive intact, unknown field names skip the retry (allowlist gating works), plain 400s with no field name don't retry, and a retry that ALSO 400s doesn't infinite-loop.

## Dashboard console-log noise filter
- The in-memory buffer that powers `/dashboard/console-log` was capturing every Next.js HTTP access line (`GET /api/version 200 in Xms`, `GET /api/settings ...`, `GET /manifest.webmanifest`, even the SSE stream that delivers the logs back to the UI). The dashboard's own polling flooded the buffer at ~1-2 req/sec and evicted real chat / auth / error traces via the maxLines cap. New `isAccessLogNoise()` filter drops the framework's specific access-log shape only when the path matches a known polling endpoint and the status is 2xx/3xx. Preserves everything that matters: any 4xx/5xx, all `[LEVEL]` tagged lines, POST/DELETE/PUT requests, Next.js startup banner, unknown future routes. Original stdout to the terminal is unchanged — only the dashboard buffer is filtered.

## Test counts
- Pre-release baseline: 947 passing / 20 expected-fail / 21 skipped (988 total)
- Post-release: 983 passing / 20 expected-fail / 21 skipped (1024 total)
- +36 new tests across 3 new test files: `cache-stickiness.test.js`, `console-log-filter.test.js`, `model-strip-reactive-retry.test.js`
- Zero regressions

## Intentionally NOT in this release
- Combo intelligence wiring (Tier 2.B) — deferred. The wiring would have `intentClassifier` + `complexityRouter` outputs change combo slot selection per request. User chose to skip rather than risk disrupting working combo behavior.
- Claude Code obfuscation stack (8 files in OmniRoute) — only worth porting if direct Anthropic accounts start getting throttled or you sign up for `anthropic-compatible-cc-*` reseller endpoints. Today's traffic routes through Claude direct (passthrough) and Antigravity (already obfuscated).
- Full compression framework port (29 files in OmniRoute) — existing RTK works. Marginal gain not worth the 20-40 hour port cost.

# v0.5.14 (2026-06-21) — Combo fallback speed + MITM stability + Auth loop fixes

Four major fixes addressing live user reports. Combos are now up to 15x
faster when hitting exhausted accounts, MITM restart loops are eliminated,
and live-fetch models correctly surface for free providers.

## Performance
- **Fast-fail combo routing for dead accounts (<1s vs 25s)**. Combos hitting
  multiple exhausted accounts (e.g. 403 "Verify your account" or 429 quota
  with long reset times) used to take 25+ seconds to fail over to a healthy
  provider due to pointless token refreshes and exponential backoff.
  - **Fix A (Token Refresh Skip):** `chatCore.js` now peeks at 403 bodies.
    If it sees "verify your account" / "permission_denied", it skips the
    OAuth token refresh entirely. Saves ~3s per dead account.
  - **Fix B (Pre-emptive 429 Parse):** `base.js` executor now checks the
    provider's `RetryInfo` *before* initiating exponential backoff. If the
    reset is >60s away, it skips the 14s retry loop and fails instantly.
    Saves ~14s per exhausted account.
  Result: A combo hitting 3 dead accounts now falls over to a healthy model
  in under 1 second. Applies to ALL providers and ALL combo strategies.

## Bug fixes
- **Infinite MITM restart loop eliminated.** Toggling MITM off/on could race
  with a queued background restart, causing an infinite loop of `Restart
  attempt 1/5 failed: MITM server is already running` every 5 seconds. Added
  a strict `!serverProcess.killed` guard to `scheduleMitmRestart()` to quietly
  drop stale restart requests.
- **Actionable 403 "Verify your account" dashboard links.** When Google flags
  an Antigravity account, kRouter now uses regex to extract the exact Google
  verification URL from the 403 body. The dashboard Connection card now
  displays `Verify your account: https://...` as a clickable link instead of
  raw truncated JSON.
- **Claude OAuth + Live Fetch Anti-Loop.** If Claude Desktop MITM was enabled,
  kRouter's own internal requests to `api.anthropic.com` (OAuth token exchange
  and provider model fetching) would hit its own MITM proxy and fail with
  `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`. All internal OAuth and model fetches now pass
  the `x-request-source: local` header, bypassing the MITM intercept.
- **Live-fetch for free/passthrough providers (Issue 2).** Users with ONLY
  free providers (MiMo Free, OpenCode Free, OpenRouter, etc.) saw the "Select
  Model" modal open completely blank. `ModelSelectModal` now kicks off
  parallel background fetches to `/api/models/live` when opened, populating
  the dropdowns instantly. Includes 5-min LRU cache and inline retry buttons.

## Verified
- Full test suite: 605 pass / 20 expected-fail / 27 fail (baseline maintained)
- Combo fast-fail logic unit-tested against real provider error bodies
- MITM anti-loop tested live via Claude Desktop

# v0.5.13 (2026-06-20) — Linux GUI launcher coverage for MITM cert trust

## Bug fix

### Linux: NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS now reaches GUI-launched Antigravity / Claude Desktop / VS Code

Symptom (Ubuntu user, post-0.5.12):
  Even after kRouter auto-wrote NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS to ~/.profile,
  ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc in 0.5.12, GUI-launched Antigravity STILL rejected
  the MITM cert and forced the user to fall back to
    NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 antigravity
  (which disables ALL TLS verification — insecure).

Root cause:
  Linux GUI launchers (GNOME Activities, KDE menu, .desktop files,
  desktop shortcuts) do NOT source shell rc files. They go through
  systemd-user / gnome-session, which only reads:
    - ~/.config/environment.d/*.conf  (systemd-user env)
    - ~/.pam_environment              (legacy PAM, deprecated but works)
    - /etc/environment                (system-wide, needs root)
  Our 0.5.12 fix only covered shell rc files → terminal-launched IDE
  worked, menu-launched IDE didn't.

Fix:
  Extended src/mitm/linuxNodeCaCerts.js to also write:
    ~/.config/environment.d/95-krouter.conf   (systemd-user, KEY=VALUE format)
    ~/.pam_environment                         (PAM, KEY DEFAULT=value format)
  in addition to the existing 4 shell rc files. 95- prefix sorts late
  so kRouter overrides earlier defaults (00-99 priority convention).
  PAM block uses BEGIN/END markers like the shell files so we can strip
  cleanly on uninstall without touching user-added PAM entries.

  src/mitm/manager.js log line updated to surface both reload paths:
    [linux-node-ca] Terminal-launched IDE: open a NEW terminal OR run: source ~/.profile
    [linux-node-ca] Menu-launched IDE (GNOME / KDE Activities, .desktop): log out + back in
                    OR run: systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user import-environment

Effect on Ubuntu user:
  Before 0.5.13: GUI Antigravity rejects MITM cert -> NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 workaround
  After 0.5.13:  GUI Antigravity -> systemd-user reads 95-krouter.conf ->
                 NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS set -> cert accepted -> MITM works.

  User must log out + back in once (or systemctl --user reload) for
  systemd-user to re-read environment.d after the upgrade.

Verified (mocked-Linux unit tests, 17/17 PASS):
  - 5 files written on first set (.profile, .bashrc, .zshrc, environment.d, pam_environment)
  - systemd file has correct KEY=VALUE format (no shell export syntax)
  - pam_environment uses correct KEY DEFAULT=value syntax
  - Idempotent: second set with same path = 0 files changed
  - Rotation: new cert path replaces all 5 surfaces in place
  - Unset: all 5 surfaces cleaned, user content preserved in shell rc files
  - systemd file fully removed (we own it); pam_environment removed when empty
  - Non-Linux platforms: early return, no-op

Plus regression: 605 pass / 20 expected-fail / 27 fail — identical baseline.

## Upgrade

    npm install -g @sifxprime/krouter@latest
    # Restart kRouter MITM (writes new env files)
    # Log out + back in once for systemd-user to pick up environment.d

# v0.5.12 (2026-06-20) — Claude Desktop MITM + account health + Linux trust + cert UI

## Features

### Claude Desktop app routing via MITM (new)
Adds DNS-hijack + TLS interception for `api.anthropic.com` so the
Anthropic Claude Desktop Electron app — which hardcodes the URL and
does NOT honor ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL — can be routed through kRouter.

Verified live: Claude Desktop chat works through kRouter with
`kr/auto` → Kiro routing. Token preview (/v1/messages/count_tokens)
and telemetry (/api/event_logging/v2/batch) both handled correctly.

Opt-in via Dashboard → MITM → Claude Desktop. Toggle MITM off to
revert instantly (api.anthropic.com removed from /etc/hosts).

Note: Claude Code CLI users do NOT need this — use ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL.

### Cert Install/Uninstall buttons in dashboard (USER3)
Self-service root certificate management. Replaces hand-running
`security add-trusted-cert` / `update-ca-certificates` / `certutil -addstore`.

New card on Dashboard → MITM shows current cert state and three buttons:
  - **Install / Reinstall Certificate** — label changes with state
  - **Uninstall**
  - **Remove Legacy 9router Cert** — appears automatically when
    `~/.9router/mitm/rootCA.crt` is detected on disk

Inline sudo password input on Mac/Linux when not cached. Windows uses
existing UAC. Auto-refreshes status after every action.

Verified end-to-end on dev machine: full uninstall → keychain check →
reinstall → keychain check cycle in 6.1s with cached sudo.

## Bug fixes

### Linux: NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS auto-write in shell rc files (USER1 + USER4)
Ubuntu Antigravity (and any other Electron/Node IDE) was rejecting the
kRouter MITM cert with `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`
even after `update-ca-certificates` ran. Root cause: Node.js + Electron
read their OWN bundled Mozilla CA store, not the OS trust store. macOS
and Windows had auto-`launchctl setenv` / `setx` for this since 0.5.6
— Linux was missing the branch entirely (helper had been removed in the
0.5.10 standalone cleanup).

Fix: new `src/mitm/linuxNodeCaCerts.js` writes a guarded BEGIN/END
block exporting `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=<cert path>` to `~/.profile`,
`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, and `~/.bash_profile` (only existing ones,
plus always-create `.profile`). Idempotent — re-running with the same
path is no-op; new path replaces in place. Stripped cleanly on MITM
stop. Wired into the existing `IS_MAC` / `IS_WIN` start/stop branches
in `src/mitm/manager.js`.

After install, log surfaces a clear notice:
```
[linux-node-ca] NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS written to 3 shell rc file(s): ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc
[linux-node-ca] ⚠ Effective in NEW shells only — restart your IDE
                (Antigravity / Claude Desktop / VS Code) OR run: source ~/.profile
```

Verified with 10/10 mocked-Linux unit tests covering idempotency,
existing-content preservation, in-place block replacement, and clean
unset.

### Free / passthroughModels providers count as active (USER2)
Users with ONLY free providers connected (MiMo Free, OpenCode Free,
OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, Grok Web — all `passthroughModels: true`)
saw the "Select Model" button disabled on every IDE / CLI tool card
and the MITM panel. Root cause: `hasActiveProviders()` gate checked
three conditions (hardcoded models > 0, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-
compatible) — all three false for passthrough providers because their
models fetch live from a remote URL, not from the hardcoded MODELS map.

Fix: added 4th OR clause `AI_PROVIDERS[provider]?.passthroughModels === true`
in both `MitmPageClient.js` and `ToolDetailClient.js` so passthrough
connections register as active. 5 providers now correctly unlocked.

### Antigravity 403 "Verify your account" — lock whole account for 1hr
When Google flags an Antigravity OAuth account for needing verification
(PERMISSION_DENIED, "Verify your account to continue"), kRouter was
locking only the specific model that errored. Since a flagged account
fails on ALL models, this caused 5+ wasted 403 requests per combo
cycle before reaching a healthy account.

Fix: new `accountLock: true` flag on `ERROR_RULES`. When matched,
writes `modelLock___all` (locks entire account) instead of per-model
lock. 1hr cooldown. Auto-clears after 1hr or on "Test connection" click.
Log now shows `WHOLE ACCOUNT locked for 3600s` vs `modelLock_X`.

### Anti-loop header on ALL outbound Anthropic calls
Every kRouter-initiated call to `api.anthropic.com` now includes
`x-request-source: local` so the MITM server passes them through to
real Anthropic instead of intercepting (infinite loop prevention).
Previously only the Antigravity quota endpoints had this header. Fixed
in `open-sse/executors/base.js buildHeaders()` (covers all providers),
`claudeAutoPing.js sendPing()`, and 3 call sites in
`open-sse/services/usage.js`.

## Verified
- Claude Desktop MITM live on Mac — HTTP 200, 11.2s, routes via `kr/auto`
- USER2 fix: 5 passthroughModels providers verified, dashboard renders 200
- USER3 fix: full uninstall → keychain verify → reinstall → keychain verify
  cycle live on dev machine (6.1s with cached sudo)
- USER1 + USER4 fix: 10/10 mocked-Linux unit tests pass (idempotency,
  preservation, replacement, unset)
- 403 verify-account: 4/4 unit tests pass
- Full test suite: 605 pass + 20 expected-fail + 27 fail (baseline)

## Upgrade
```
npm install -g @sifxprime/krouter@latest
```
No data migration. Existing MITM cert, OAuth tokens, settings preserved.


# v0.5.11 (2026-06-20) — CLI menu reliability + final 9router scrub

Two real bug fixes + the last batch of standalone cleanups.

## Bug fixes

### CLI terminal-UI was reading the wrong field name
The 0.5.10 standalone cleanup renamed the API response field
`has9Router` → `hasKRouter` everywhere — but only on the WEB dashboard
side. `cli/src/cli/menus/cliTools.js` (the in-terminal `krouter` menu
that lets you configure Claude / Codex / OpenCode / etc. from the
prompt) still read `has9Router`, got undefined, and silently treated
every installed IDE as "not configured." Tooling-status checks in the
TUI were effectively broken since 0.5.10. Fixed.

### Arrow-key "move down sometimes doesn't work" on first menu
When you run `krouter`, the interface menu appears after ~2 seconds
(server warm-up). Impatient users press arrow keys during that wait.
The bytes sit in stdin's cooked-mode buffer. When raw mode engages and
the keypress listener attaches, those buffered bytes arrive as a flood
of half-parsed escape sequences — `\x1b[B` (down arrow) sometimes gets
fragmented across reads, so the first one or two presses register as
garbage instead of a `down` event. Now `selectMenu` calls `drainStdin()`
right after `primeRawOnce()`, discarding any pre-menu buffered bytes so
only keys pressed AFTER the menu is on screen drive selection. The
flake disappears.

## Standalone scrub (the rest)

### Stale 9router refs cleaned out of code paths still hit at runtime
  - `cli/src/cli/api/client.js` — last copy of the `~/.9router` →
    `~/.krouter` data-dir migration block. Removed.
  - `cli/src/cli/menus/cliTools.js` — `OR custom:9Router-0` model-id
    fallback + `?? providers["9router"]` dual-read + `(?:krouter|9router)`
    model-prefix regex. All tightened to `krouter` only.
  - `src/lib/mcp/stdioSseBridge.js` — global state key
    `__9routerMcpBridges` → `__krouterMcpBridges`; user-visible
    "truncated by 9router bridge" message → "by kRouter bridge"
  - `cli/scripts/build-cli.js` — build-script title + a stale comment
  - `cli/hooks/sqliteRuntime.js` — already cleaned in 0.5.10, verified

### package-lock.json regenerated
The `cli/package-lock.json` still listed `9router` as a bin entry from
when the package.json bin section was changed in 0.5.10. Regenerated.

### Comment cleanup (non-runtime)
About a dozen JSDoc + inline comments updated from "9router" to
"kRouter" across kiroConstants, kiroModels, sessionManager,
commandcode, openai-to-kiro, paramSupport, kiro MITM handler,
tailscale, copilot MITM. Zero behavioral impact.

## Intentional keeps (still grep "9router" if you look)

  - `Footer.js` + `README.md` upstream attribution (MIT license)
  - `MITM cert CN "9Router MITM Root CA"` (changing breaks existing
    user trust stores)
  - `ENCRYPT_SALT "9router-mitm-pwd"` (changing bricks saved sudo
    passwords)
  - `X-CLIENT-TYPE: 9router` / `grok-cli/9router` / `X-Msh-Platform:
    9router` HTTP headers (3rd-party APIs whitelist by name)
  - `claudeAutoPing.js` + `capabilities.js` port-source comments
    (factual provenance notes)
  - Linux trust-store: uninstall path still removes BOTH
    `9router-root-ca.crt` AND `krouter-root-ca.crt` so a
    pre-rebrand user's keychain stays clean

## Verified
  - 605 pass + 20 expected-fail + 27 fail (identical baseline, zero regressions)
  - node --check on every modified file passes
  - cli/package-lock.json bin section now `{"krouter": "cli.js"}` only

## Upgrade path for users on < 0.5.11

If `krouter` works but `9router` ALSO works (leftover shim):
```
npm uninstall -g @sifxprime/krouter
npm install -g @sifxprime/krouter@latest
```

# v0.5.10 (2026-06-20) — standalone: drop 9router legacy plumbing

Cleanup release. The fork has been on its own brand long enough that the
9router → krouter migration plumbing is now dead weight. This release
rips out every legacy compatibility path, dual-read, and migration
helper that hasn't fired in months.

What got dropped
  - `9router` bin alias from `cli/package.json` (only `krouter` works now)
  - `~/.9router → ~/.krouter` auto-migration in dataDir.js, paths.js,
    cli.js, appUpdater.js, updater.js, mitmAliasCache.js — single
    canonical APP_NAME, no LEGACY_* constants
  - Coexistence warning (added in 0.5.8 — moot now)
  - `NINE_ROUTER_*` env var dual-read + deprecation warning in
    outboundProxy.js — only `KROUTER_*` is recognized
  - 3 catalog entries for `NINE_ROUTER_*` from the Environment panel
  - "9router" provider key dual-read in 12 IDE settings routes:
    codex, jcode, opencode, openclaw, kilo, droid, copilot, cline,
    deepseek-tui, hermes, claude, cowork — only `krouter` keys read +
    written now
  - `LEGACY_PROVIDER_KEY` / `LEGACY_AUTH_KEY` / `LEGACY_ENV_FILE` /
    `LEGACY_CUSTOM_ID_PREFIX` / `LEGACY_API_KEY_ENV_VAR` constants and
    every site that referenced them
  - `has9Router` legacy API field in 12 IDE settings responses + 12 UI
    components that read it — single `hasKRouter` field everywhere
  - `com.9router.autostart` LaunchAgent / `9router.vbs` / `9router.desktop`
    legacy cleanup helpers in autostart.js — single-entry-per-platform
  - `9router` cmdline pattern in `killAllAppProcesses` (cli.js +
    appUpdater.js) — only matches `krouter`
  - `sk_9router` placeholder API key fallback → `sk_krouter`
  - Stale "9router-relay" Deno deployer label → "krouter-relay"
  - Stale `getLegacyProviderEnvPath()` helper in jcode-settings
  - Comment text mentioning legacy across cli/mitm/translator paths
  - Navigation.js upstream-credit links — redirected to sifxprime/krouter
    (Footer attribution kept — MIT license requirement)

What was intentionally kept
  - Landing Footer attribution to decolua/9router (MIT license)
  - README upstream attribution badges + "hardened fork of 9Router" text
  - 9Router MITM Root CA common name (changing CN would invalidate every
    existing user's installed MITM cert and force them to re-trust)
  - 9router-mitm-pwd encryption salt (used to derive the cert-store
    password key — changing it would brick saved sudo passwords)
  - X-CLIENT-TYPE / X-Msh-Platform / grok-cli/9router HTTP headers
    (third-party APIs whitelist by name)
  - Linux trust-store cert filename uninstall path keeps removing both
    `9router-root-ca.crt` and `krouter-root-ca.crt`

Upgrade impact
  Existing kRouter installs: zero. Anyone running 0.5.7+ has long since
  converged to `~/.krouter` and writes only canonical config keys.
  Users still on the upstream `9router` package who never installed
  kRouter: they need to manually rename `~/.9router` → `~/.krouter`
  before first launch. Anyone in that group is also clearly running
  a different product (upstream is a separate npm package).

Verified
  - node --check on every file in the diff (35+ files)
  - 605 pass + 20 expected-fail + 27 fail — identical baseline, zero
    regressions

# v0.5.9 (2026-06-19) — Windows EADDRINUSE crash-loop fix

Single-purpose patch release. Symptom reported on Windows after upgrading
to 0.5.8:

```
⨯ Failed to start server
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:20128
⚠️  Server exited (code=1). Restarting in 1s... (1/2)
[repeated forever]
```

Two real bugs surfaced by the upgrade:

1. **`killProcessOnPort` only killed the first PID from `netstat`.** Windows
   Next.js spawns a parent + child pair (the dev runner + the actual
   `next-server`); on graceful shutdown only the parent dies and the child
   inherits the listen socket. Killing just the first PID left the child
   still bound to the port. Now sweeps ALL PIDs returned by `netstat`
   (Windows) / `lsof -ti` (macOS/Linux), uses `taskkill /F /T` to kill the
   whole process tree on Windows, and waits 1s on Windows (vs 500ms
   elsewhere) for the kernel to release the socket.

2. **The restart loop didn't re-kill on EADDRINUSE.** When the first start
   failed because a stale process held the port, `tryRestart` just respawned
   blindly into the same conflict — forever. New EADDRINUSE-aware recovery
   path detects "address already in use" in the captured crash log, runs
   `killAllAppProcesses` + `killProcessOnPort` AGAIN, then probes the port
   with a one-shot `net.createServer` before respawning. If the port is
   still occupied after the cleanup, exits with an actionable error:

   ```
   ❌ Port 20128 is still occupied after attempted cleanup.
      Identify the holder (Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :20128;
      macOS/Linux: lsof -i:20128).
      Either stop that process, or run kRouter on a different port:
      krouter --port <N>
   ```

   No more infinite "Disabling MIT and restarting..." (which was the wrong
   recovery anyway — EADDRINUSE has nothing to do with MITM, which runs on
   port 26139).

Verified
  - node --check passes
  - Isolated unit test: spawn victim child holding port → run kill logic →
    probe → port free → PROBE OK
  - Excludes own PID (won't suicide)

# v0.5.8 (2026-06-19) — security, brand polish, performance, upstream catch-up

25 commits since 0.5.7 — full audit pass with live end-to-end verification on the dev machine, zero test regressions throughout.

## Security
- **GHSA-6mwv-4mrm-5p3m — Kiro AWS region SSRF (HIGH).** Port of upstream `126aa24`. Seven `${region}` URL-interpolation sites in `src/lib/oauth/providers.js` and `src/lib/oauth/services/kiro.js` were unvalidated — a malicious value like `region="us-east-1.attacker.com#"` would have redirected the OAuth flow to an attacker host. New `assertValidAwsRegion()` helper with `/^[a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-\d{1,2}$/` allowlist now gates every interpolation. 12/12 attack vectors blocked in unit tests.
- **2 HIGH npm CVEs eliminated.** `undici` 7.0.0–7.27.2 (TLS cert validation bypass in SOCKS5 ProxyAgent + cache disclosure) → 7.28.0; `http-proxy-middleware` 3.0.4–3.0.6 (CRLF injection in `fixRequestBody`) → 3.0.7. Both already in MITM/proxy paths. Only 2 moderate `postcss` advisories remain (transitive via Next 16, fix would be a breaking Next downgrade — left).

## Performance — Anthropic + Antigravity rate-limit storms
- **Claude Usage per-token 3-min cooldown + stale-while-revalidate cache** (`open-sse/services/usage.js`). The Quota Tracker page auto-refreshes every 60s × N connections. Anthropic rate-limits per IP — once any Claude account 429'd, every subsequent call from the same IP also 429'd, blanking the entire Claude card. Now on any 429, that token sits in 3-min cooldown returning cached-good data (slightly stale, real numbers) instead of placeholder. **17× quieter** against Anthropic during cooldown windows. Also skip the legacy admin-only fallback when status is 429 (saves 2 wasted calls per rate-limit event). Cooldown latency dropped 400ms → 6ms (pure-memory, no I/O).
- **Antigravity retry-storm fix** (`open-sse/executors/antigravity.js`). 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED with a 73-min reset was triggering 14-28s of pointless 2-4-8s auto-retries per URL × multiple combo models → up to 4 min per request on big projects. Root causes: regex looked for `"reset after"` but Google sends `"Resets in"`; and we never parsed the canonical `error.details[].retryDelay` field (e.g. `"4406.752244244s"`). New `parseRetryFromErrorJson()` reads the machine-readable RetryInfo first; widened message-text regex covers current Google phrasing, beta Antigravity variant, token-bucket style, and bare durations. Combo now advances to the next model in the same instant.
- **`claudeAutoPing` skips disabled accounts.** When the OAuth-usage endpoint reports `extra_usage.disabled_reason` (e.g. `"out_of_credits"`, `"account_suspended"`), the scheduler stops trying for 1 hour and logs the reason once per state-change. Recovery (credits topped up, suspension lifted) is auto-detected within the next hour and logged. Saves wasted POSTs to `/v1/messages` that Anthropic would reject anyway.

## Bug fixes
- **Kiro MITM dropped images** (`src/mitm/handlers/kiro.js`). When users attached an image in Kiro IDE chat, the AWS-CodeWhisperer→OpenAI converter read `userInputMessage.content` and `userInputMessageContext.toolResults` but ignored `userInputMessage.images[]`. Every image silently disappeared before reaching the downstream model — which would then hallucinate about random files in the filesystem context to fill the gap. Now converts each `{ format, source.bytes }` entry to standard OpenAI `{ type:"image_url", image_url:{ url:"data:image/<mime>;base64,..." } }` content blocks. 8/8 unit test cases (text-only / image-only / text+N / tool+image combo / format normalization jpg→jpeg / malformed-skip / fallback to png).
- **Claude usage misleading "admin permissions" message.** The legacy fallback used to say "requires admin permissions" regardless of why the OAuth endpoint failed. Now branches on the OAuth status: 429 → "rate-limited", 401 → "rejected the access token — try reconnecting", 5xx → "upstream error", other → existing scoped message.
- **Perplexity `/v1/models` endpoint fix** (port of upstream `db4499d`). Perplexity deprecated `/models` (404); switched both test-connection and live-models routes to `/v1/models`.
- **claudeAutoPing dual-write consolidation.** The Providers detail page wrote `settings.claudeAutoPing.connections` from stale local state; the Usage page used safer fetch-then-patch. Toggling auto-ping on Page A then Page B could clobber A's update. Providers page now mirrors Usage's race-safe pattern.

## Features ported from upstream
- **Claude auto-ping** (`740093d`) — warms each Claude OAuth connection's 5h quota window by sending a 1-token "hi" the moment the window resets. Per-connection toggle (bolt icon) on Settings → Providers → Claude AND Dashboard → Usage. New `src/shared/services/claudeAutoPing.js` scheduler + `CLAUDE_AUTOPING_CONFIG` in `src/shared/constants/config.js` + UI integration on both surfaces.
- **Fusion combo strategy** (`87e5c1c`) — third combo strategy alongside fallback/round-robin. Fans the prompt out to all panel models in parallel, then a judge model synthesizes one final answer. Quorum-grace collection caps the straggler penalty (8s after `minPanel=2` succeed); 90s panel hard timeout; anonymized "Source N" labels prevent judge brand-bias; degrades gracefully (0 answers → 503, 1 answer → direct return, 2+ → judge synthesizes). Per-combo strategy `Select` replaces the round-robin toggle; fusion reveals a judge-model picker on the Combos page.
- **Custom vision models in selector** (`5e5e78d`) — user-added `imageToText` custom models now appear in the LLM picker with `capabilities: { vision: true }` instead of being filtered out.
- **Kiro thinking-effort budgets** (`2ff1124`) — Kiro requests with `reasoning_effort: "low"` get 1024 thinking tokens, "high" gets 24576 (was always 16000 default — caused visible CoT to leak into chat on low-effort tasks).
- **Antigravity Gemini schema** (`db9ec3a`) — strip `optional` field from tool schemas before sending to Gemini (Google rejects it).
- **claude-to-openai non-streaming** (`411a589`) — handle OpenAI-format responses from xiaomi-tokenplan -claude models on the non-streaming path; strip `reasoning_content` only when content is non-empty.
- **Image routing prefix collision** (`047fdc8`) — compatible nodes can no longer shadow built-in provider aliases like `cf/...`.
- **Antigravity output_config strip + Xiaomi always-OpenAI** (`3f9382d` partial) — strip Claude adaptive fields Google rejects; always use OpenAI `/chat/completions` for Xiaomi.

## New dashboard surface
- **Settings → Environment panel** (`/dashboard/environment`). 47 catalogued env vars in 8 categories (App, Security, Network/Proxy, MITM/Tunnel, OAuth, Observability, Updater, plus "Other" for uncatalogued `KROUTER_*`/`NINE_ROUTER_*`/`MITM_*`/etc. set in env). Live values shown, secrets masked (`INITIAL_PASSWORD` displays as `to••••••••23`), deprecated `NINE_ROUTER_*` flagged with amber badge, eye-icon to reveal, search + "only show set" filter. New `/api/settings/environment` endpoint, sidebar entry under System → Environment.

## Upgrade safety
- **`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env-var migration + dangling autostart sweep** (`src/mitm/paths.js`, `cli/src/cli/tray/autostart.js`). For v0.5.6 → v0.5.7 upgraders who had MITM enabled, the system-wide env var still pointed at `~/.9router/mitm/rootCA.crt`. Every Node child process (including npm) saw the stale path. Now `migrateNodeExtraCaCerts()` updates the OS env var to the new cert path via `launchctl setenv` / `setx` immediately after the dir rename. Plus `sweepDanglingAutostartEntries()` on startup detects + removes LaunchAgent / .desktop / .vbs entries whose binary path no longer exists on disk (e.g. when the legacy `9router` global package was uninstalled).
- **Legacy `~/.9router/` coexistence warning** (`src/lib/dataDir.js`, `cli/cli.js`). Auto-migration only fires when the target is absent. Users who ran a pre-rename build mid-session then upgraded kept two parallel data dirs silently forever. Now warns once per process when both exist, gives exact merge/remove commands. Does NOT auto-delete (user data).
- **`KROUTER_*` env-var aliases with deprecation log** (`src/lib/network/outboundProxy.js`). Proxy env vars were still `NINE_ROUTER_PROXY_URL`/etc. only — users setting `KROUTER_PROXY_URL` were silently ignored. Now dual-reads (canonical preferred), dual-writes (existing IDE/shell hooks keep working), one-shot deprecation warning per process when only the legacy name is set.

## Brand polish
- **Hero CTA link** (`src/app/landing/components/HeroSection.js`) — "View on GitHub" above-the-fold pointed at `decolua/9router`; now `sifxprime/krouter`.
- **README install + quickstart blocks** — `~/.9router` → `~/.krouter`, `sk-9router-XXXX` → `sk-krouter-XXXX`, "Point AI tool at 9router" → "at kRouter"; OpenClaw config example updated to current `krouter` provider key + `sk_krouter` placeholder; env-var table defaults corrected. Upstream-Docker callout section kept unchanged (still correctly documents upstream's published image).
- **Tray icons regenerated as Kodelyth Mark.** `cli/src/cli/tray/icon.png` was stale 32×32 PNG from Jun 13, predating the brand mark — on Windows the tray showed a generic icon. Re-rendered from the exact Sidebar.js inline SVG (rounded-square tile with brand-500 → brand-700 gradient + white chevron forward + 25% ghost trail). `icon.ico` is now **multi-size 16+32+48** instead of single 32×32, so Windows tray renders crisp at every DPI scale. `public/favicon.svg` is now a standalone brand-500 chevron — browser tab matches the rebrand.
- **Update endpoint error string** (`src/app/api/version/update/route.js:7`) — `"9router CLI"` → `"kRouter CLI"`.
- 2 stale `9Router` refs in `cli/src/cli/tray/tray.ps1` + `cli/src/cli/tray/copilot.js` MITM handler + `src/app/globals.css` CSS comment + 2 stale `~/.9router/runtime` doc/log strings.

## LAN-safety polish
- **LAN-exposure warning** (`cli/cli.js`). On default `0.0.0.0` bind, prints a yellow startup line: `⚠ Network-exposed: reachable at http://<lan-ip>:<port> (bound 0.0.0.0). Use --host 127.0.0.1 for local-only.` Previously you had no signal the dashboard was reachable from your LAN. Port of upstream's `getLanIp` helper.

# v0.5.7 (2026-06-18) — kRouter rebrand: visible surfaces + safe migrations

Final rebrand pass turning every user-visible "9router/9Router" identifier into the canonical `krouter/kRouter` name, with one-time migrations on disk so existing v0.5.x installs upgrade cleanly with zero data loss and zero double-launch.

## Data directory rename with auto-migration
- `~/.9router/` → `~/.krouter/` (Windows: `%APPDATA%\9router\` → `%APPDATA%\krouter\`). Idempotent `fs.renameSync` runs on first launch only when the new dir doesn't exist and the legacy one does — wired into five separate entry points (`src/mitm/paths.js`, `src/lib/dataDir.js`, `cli/cli.js`, `cli/hooks/sqliteRuntime.js`, `cli/src/cli/api/client.js`) so any process startup path migrates.
- Linux MITM trust-store file renamed `9router-root-ca.crt` → `krouter-root-ca.crt`. Uninstall removes both.
- macOS keychain CN unchanged ("9Router MITM Root CA") — keychain trusts by CN not file path, so the cert moves with the data dir and HTTPS keeps working with zero re-trust prompts.

## CLI tools rename with dual-read backward compat
Every IDE config writer (OpenCode, OpenClaw, JCode, Codex, Kilo, Cline, Copilot, Hermes, DeepSeek-TUI, Droid, Cowork-MCP) now writes the canonical `krouter` provider key, and detects the legacy `9router` key as a read-fallback. On the next "Apply" click the user's IDE config converges to canonical names. Specifics:
- OpenCode `provider["krouter"]`, model prefix `krouter/`, dual-match regex `^(?:krouter|9router)\/`
- OpenClaw `providers["krouter"]` in `models.providers`, `agents.list`, and per-agent `models.json`
- JCode `providers["krouter"]`, env file renamed `provider-krouter.env`, env var `JCODE_KROUTER_API_KEY`; legacy env file removed on write; CLI flag now `jcode --provider-profile krouter`
- Codex `model_provider = "krouter"`, `[model_providers.krouter]` section; legacy section removed on next save
- Droid `custom:kRouter-N` IDs; legacy `custom:9Router-N` detected as fallback
- 25+ `sk_9router` localhost placeholder API keys → `sk_krouter` (not validated server-side, safe to rename)
- localStorage key for endpoint presets migrated; legacy key read once then removed

## CLI / system-tray visible surfaces
- Tray menu label + tooltip: `9Router (Port N)` → `kRouter (Port N)`
- Console messages: `🔔 9Router is running in tray` → `🔔 kRouter ...`
- Terminal UI title + breadcrumb: `📡 kRouter Terminal UI`
- macOS plist log paths: `/tmp/krouter.log` + `/tmp/krouter.error.log`
- npm postinstall log prefix: `[krouter] runtime SQLite deps ready`
- Tray + SQLite runtime npm-package name: `krouter-runtime`
- Linux .desktop `Name=kRouter`, `Comment=kRouter API Proxy`

## Autostart bundle ID migration with self-kill protection
The macOS LaunchAgent identifier moved from `com.9router.autostart` → `com.krouter.autostart`. A `cleanupLegacyMacOSAutostart()` helper runs on every enable/disable: unloads the legacy plist with launchd, deletes the file from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`, then writes the new one. Self-kill protection: if the current Node process IS the running legacy launchd-managed agent, the unload step is skipped (would SIGTERM us mid-execution) — file removal alone is sufficient, launchd releases the agent on next login. Linux `.desktop` and Windows `.vbs` filenames migrate the same way (legacy file removed before new file written). `isAutoStartEnabled()` returns true for either entry so a pre-rename install still reads as enabled until next toggle.

## Dashboard sidebar wordmark
Now rendered in CAPITAL via Tailwind `uppercase` + 0.04em tracking — `KROUTER` with `v0.5.7` below. Kodelyth Mark on the brand-orange tile unchanged.

## Intentionally NOT changed
- HTTP wire-protocol identifiers (`X-CLIENT-TYPE`, `X-Msh-Platform`, `grok-cli/9router` user-agent, `x-9r-cli-token`, `9r-cli-auth`) — sent to/shared with third-party services or between client+server; renaming requires coordinated changes with no user benefit.
- `decolua/9router` upstream-credit links in landing nav/footer — intentional attribution to fork source.

## Verification on maintainer's machine
- `~/.9router/` (1.4 MB `data.sqlite`, auth, jwt-secret, machine-id, MITM cert) → `~/.krouter/` migrated in-place, all files intact, zero data loss.
- `com.9router.autostart.plist` cleanly removed; `com.krouter.autostart.plist` registered with launchd, PID 94237 running, exactly one router process (no double-launch).
- `/api/version` HTTP 200 from dev server; every cli-tools settings endpoint compiles and reaches auth gate (HTTP 401), no 500s.
- All 41 modified files pass `node --check`; zero errors or warnings in dev log.

# v0.4.80+sifxprime.1 (2026-06-15) — fork hardening pass

Hardening overlay on top of upstream `decolua/9router@v0.4.80`. Eleven audit findings closed across nine atomic commits; each fix carries a unit test that reproduces the BEFORE behavior plus live end-to-end verification through Kiro → MITM → router → real provider. Bug 11 from the audit was dropped after empirical disproof.

## Security
- **API SSRF guard on user-supplied `baseUrl`** — `GET /api/providers/[id]/models` now validates the OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible base URLs. Blocks cloud metadata endpoints (AWS `169.254.169.254`, ECS `169.254.170.2`, Alibaba `100.100.100.200`, GCP `metadata.google.internal`), wildcard binds, and non-`http(s)` schemes. Loopback and private LAN ranges still allowed for self-hosted LLMs. (Bug 3, c8e3636)
- **Timing-safe CLI token compare** — replaced naive `===` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` via a `safeEqString` helper. 200k-sample test: byte-position timing ratio drops from 2.22× (OLD oracle) to 0.96× (within noise band). (Bug 9, d680881)
- **Per-IP brute-force lockout on auth failures** — new `src/lib/auth/apiAuthLimiter.js`. 10-fail threshold, progressive lockout 30 s → 2 m → 10 m → 30 m, 1 h auto-reset, per-IP isolation. Held in a separate bucket from login attempts. Loopback origins explicitly skip the limiter to avoid collateral damage on the `"unknown"` IP fallback bucket. (Bug 10, d680881)
- **EventStream encoder bounds checks** — `kiro.js` `encodeHeader` now throws on header-name > 255 B and value > 65 535 B; `buildEventStreamFrame` caps total frame at 16 MiB. Prevents silent uint8/uint16 wrap-around producing corrupt frames that surface in Kiro as `"Truncated event message received"`. (Bug 12, 660eaa0)

## Concurrency & Auth
- **No mutation of caller credentials on token refresh** — `chatCore.handleChatCore` replaced `Object.assign(credentials, newCredentials)` with `{ ...credentials, ...newCredentials }` and threaded the new object into the retry. Eliminates a race where two concurrent requests sharing the same credentials reference could see each other's tokens swapped mid-stream. (Bug 1, 6020127)
- **Retry response always adopted after refresh** — the 401-retry block no longer keeps the stale 401 when the retry returns non-ok or throws. Downstream `parseUpstreamError` now reports the actual failure cause instead of `"Unauthorized"`. (Bug 2, f009fca)
- **Atomic `backoffLevel` read-modify-write** — new `updateProviderConnectionAtomic(id, computeUpdates)` in `connectionsRepo.js`; `markAccountUnavailable` rewritten to compute inside the transaction. Concurrent failures no longer lose increments and stall exponential backoff at +1. (Bug 8, a16f685)

## MITM stream layer
- **Upstream HTTP errors surfaced to Kiro as `exception` frames** — `pipeTransformedEventStream` previously hard-coded HTTP 200 with content-type `application/vnd.amazon.eventstream` and dropped the upstream body for any non-OK response. Now reads the error body and emits a parseable AWS EventStream frame with `:message-type=exception` carrying the upstream message. (Bug 6, a05186a)
- **Pipe loops resilient to mid-stream read errors** — `pipeSSE`, `pipeTransformedSSE`, `pipeTransformedEventStream` now wrap the read loop in `try/catch/finally`. On `ECONNRESET` / `socket hang up` / abort: log, run transform-flush, emit a terminal frame (EventStream exception or SSE `[DONE]`), guarantee `res.end()`. Previously the client connection hung until the OS-level socket timeout. Verified: fake router that destroys mid-stream now closes the curl client in ~300 ms with a parseable terminal frame instead of hanging. (Bug 7, 14da886)
- **MITM `requestTimeout = 0`** — disabled Node's default 5-minute `requestTimeout` and `headersTimeout` on the MITM HTTPS server so long-running agentic streams (Kiro extended-thinking, multi-tool analysis) aren't cut mid-frame. (baseline, 6457f87)

## Routing & efficiency
- **Combo recursion depth guard** — added `MAX_COMBO_RECURSION_DEPTH = 3`. A misconfigured combo that cycles (`comboA → comboB → comboA`) or chains too deep now returns HTTP 400 `"Combo recursion limit exceeded"` instead of overflowing the call stack. (Bug 5, 21e8390)
- **Single `getSettings()` per request** — `chat.js` previously read settings 2–3× per request (top-level + inside the `while(true)` account-fallback loop + a third time in the nested-combo branch). Now read once at the top of `handleChat` and threaded through. (Bug 4, 21e8390)

## Verification methodology
Every fix shipped with:
- A standalone Node test file that **reproduces the BEFORE behavior** under controlled conditions (race simulations, mock streams that throw mid-read, statistical timing of `===` vs `timingSafeEqual`, etc.) and confirms the **AFTER** behavior fixes it.
- A live end-to-end run through the full stack (real Kiro client → MITM → 9router dev server → real provider), verifying the happy path still returns the expected 200 / 551 B / 4-frame EventStream and that the bug-trigger conditions produce the documented graceful behavior.
- For SSRF (Bug 3): live tests with temp DB rows confirming `169.254.169.254` blocks at HTTP 400 + reason, `api.openai.com` reaches upstream, `192.168.x` LAN IPs pass through to the fetch.
- For Bug 11 (audit drop): empirical test of `pipeWithDisconnect` showed `upstream.cancel()` fires within 1 ms of client disconnect via `reader.cancel()` propagation through `pipeThrough`. The "fake writer" stub is necessary (the writable side is locked by `pipeThrough`) and harmless. No fix needed.
